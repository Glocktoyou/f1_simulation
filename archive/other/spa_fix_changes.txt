Applied fixes to reduce unrealistically fast Spa lap times:

1) Vehicle parameter changes (in `F1Vehicle.__init__`):
   - Lowered `tire_mu_peak` from 1.8 to 1.5
   - Added `C_rr = 0.015` (rolling resistance coefficient)
   - Added `drivetrain_efficiency = 0.92`
   - Added `max_torque_force = 90000` (low-speed torque/force cap)

2) In `simulate_real_track` control loop:
   - Restricted DRS activation to long straights: require `segment['length'] >= 300`
   - Introduced a speed-dependent effective tire mu (`mu_eff`) that decays slightly at very high speeds
   - Replaced idealized engine_force with: `min((max_power / velocity) * drivetrain_efficiency, max_torque_force)`
   - Subtracted rolling resistance (`C_rr * mass * g`) from net_force

3) Corner speed computation:
   - Use the effective mu when computing corner speed limits inside the simulation loop

Why these changes:
 - Rolling resistance and drivetrain losses lower unrealistic top speeds
 - Torque/gear cap prevents infinite/very large low-speed forces
 - Reduced/variable mu avoids unrealistically high lateral grip at very high speeds
 - Restricting DRS prevents excessive use of DRS in short segments

Next steps (optional):
 - Add elevation/slope for Eau Rouge/Kemmel to add energy cost on uphill
 - Introduce gear ratios or a simple torque map for more realistic acceleration
 - Add brake power/fade model for more realistic deceleration
